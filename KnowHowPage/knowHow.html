                    Thermal spraying: ideal corrosion protection
                </div>
                <p>
                    Metallising is a process subject to the ISO 2063 STANDARD, which consists of melting metal in wire or powder form inside a flame or electric arc spraying gun, and of spraying it molten using compresse air, over steel stripped beforehand with abrasive jets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zinc sprayed in this way, instantaneously solidifies in contact with the stell surface, and forms a zinc coating. Anti-corrosion protection is thus immediate. Adding a sealer is recommended though, since the metal coating is slightly porous.

       <p>
        Zinc and zinc-aluminium coatings are generally reinforced by applying liquid or powder paints. Apart from the aesthetic appearance, the paints protect the surface and increase the lifetime of a metal coating.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquid paint is applied in several layers: the first layer, mandatory for an optimum anti-corrosion result, called the sealer layer, is very diluted in order to properly penetrate the porosity of the metal coating. The additional paint layers, called intermediate or finish layers, are then appled. As for powder paint, it can be applied as a single layer or as a double layer.

            Why metallise using zinc or zinc-aluminium?
        </div>
        <div>
            Zinc-aluminium metallising coating combines the advantages of the two metals. It provides the cathodic protection which is specific to zinc, and also provides high chemical resistance against aggressive environments by the addition of aluminium.
